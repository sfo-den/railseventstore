# RailsEventStoreActiveRecord::Legacy

An Active Record based implementation of events repository for [Rails Event Store](https://github.com/RailsEventStore/rails_event_store).

This is the legacy repository used in `rails_event_store` gem. Exists for limited backwards-compatibilty and should not be chosen for new projects.
