# RubyEventStore ROM Event Repository

A Ruby Object Model (ROM) implementation of events repository for [Ruby Event Store](https://github.com/RailsEventStore/rails_event_store).

This version of the ROM adapter supports [rom-sql](https://github.com/rom-rb/rom-sql) at this time. It is an alternative to the ActiveRecord `EventRepository` implementation used in `rails_event_store` gem.

_Additonal backing stores via ROM are being tracked here: [#299](https://github.com/RailsEventStore/rails_event_store/issues/299)._
